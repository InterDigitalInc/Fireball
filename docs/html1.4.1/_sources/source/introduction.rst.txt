Introduction
============
Fireball is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) library for creating, training, evaluating, quantizing, and compressing DNN based models across a range of applications.

Features
~~~~~~~~
Here is a summary of main features:

* Support for a wide range of classification, regression, object detection, and NLP applications.
* Easily create any network structure using a limited set of fundamental building blocks chained together in a text string.
* Add functionality by creating your own "Blocks" and reuse them in your network structure.
* Apply Low-Rank decomposition on specified layers to reduce the number of network parameters.
* Apply K-Means quantization on network parameter to further reduce the size of model.
* Support for training compressed/quantized models.
* Export the compressed/quantized model to CoreML for iOS deployment.
